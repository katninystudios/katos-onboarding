# ‚ú® KatOS Onboarding
The onboarding process for KatOS.

> [!NOTE]
> This is NOT the installer! This is the post-install onboarding process to create a user account, install apps, and more.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About
This is the codebase for the KatOS onboarding process, allowing users to create their first user account, set up their preferred software, and to run other background tasks to set up KatOS for the user, rather than having to have them to do it.

The point of the onboarding process is to make KatOS approachable by the average user who may be only used to the Windows onboarding process, or none at all. We should not have users manually, say, install a browser via the console because we do not ship one by default, the onboarding process installs the browser!
